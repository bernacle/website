      description: `I was one of the initial engineers when the company consisted only of the founders and myself. Collaborating closely with the CTO, I contributed significantly to the development of a travel rule API and dashboard, enabling crypto companies to adhere to country regulations.
      My involvement extended to key projects, including crafting a decision rules engine for transactions, developing a widget for exchanges to collect data, and more recently, assisting in the transition from a monorepo to more agile microservices. In this transformation, we utilized Kafka to ensure better communication, elevate overall system availability, and enhance scalability.
      In the dynamic setting of a startup's early stages, my role expanded beyond technical contributions. I actively participated in hiring, interviewing, and onboarding new engineersâ€”reflecting the versatility required in wearing multiple hats to support the company's growth.`,
